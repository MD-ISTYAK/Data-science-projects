# Problem Statement🎯
Transport and communication is one of the crucial domain in field of analytics. 
Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people. Seeking for new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, 
are being recognized as ways to cope and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.

# What is Bird Strike ?🤔
A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.

# Conclusion😊
42.72% incidents where pilot was warned about the birds

Prior warning to the pilot reduces the risk of damage to the aircraft

52.78% of incidents have happened due to some small unknown bird.

72.9% incidents have happened when there is 1 bird/wildlife is struck in the airplane and caused damage.

90.31% incidents caused no damage while 9.69% incidents caused damage

80.84% of bird strike incidents have happened when the altitude of airplane was <1000 ft and 19.16% have happened when altitude was >1000 ft...
